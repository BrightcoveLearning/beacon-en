    <p>The functionality of adding secondary pages to playlists permits you to create a thumbnail in a playlist that when clicked opens a new page. For instance, say you have 20 playlists that fit under the <em>Outdoor Adventures</em> page, but you don't want that many carousels on a single page. Using secondary pages you can group the 20 videos into separate secondary pages then add the secondary pages to the <em>Outdoor Adventures</em> page. Here is a short video that illustrates the concept:</p>
    <div class="training-video-player-ipx" data-experience="5a73630f7afd7a00101bc1b5" data-video-ids="1742148386349197472">&nbsp;</div>

    <p>To be sure the terminology is clear, here are some key definitions:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Main pages</strong> - Pages that can appear in the navigation of the app. Main pages cannot be used in playlists.</li>
      <li><strong>Secondary pages</strong> - Pages that can be put into a playlist. You can think of a secondary page as a "child" of a main page. Secondary pages cannot be used in the navigation of the app. Details on creating secondary pages follow in this document.</li>
      <li><strong>Page card</strong> - A thumbnail created for a secondary page that appears when added to a playlist. Details on creating page cards follow in this document.</li>
    </ul>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">There are three documents concerning secondary pages and their use. They are:
      <ul>
        <li><a href="/layout-copy/adding-pages-to-playlists.html">Adding Pages to Playlists</a> - Teaches how to use secondary pages as "child" pages to a main page. (this document)</li>
