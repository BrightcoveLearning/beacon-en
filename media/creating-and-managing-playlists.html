    <p>A playlist is a collection of videos that are grouped together in a particular order for playback in a player. The Media module makes it easy to create Video Cloud playlists and add videos to a playlist. After you've created a playlist, you can add it to a page or publish it in a player. </p>
    <p>For information on publishing playlists, see <a href="/publish-videos/publishing-videos-and-playlists-media-module.html">Publishing Videos and Playlists</a>. For more information about playlists, including best practices and tips for using them effectively, see <a href="/media/introduction-playlists.html">Introduction to Playlists</a>.</p>

    <h2 id="types">Types of Video Cloud playlists</h2>
    <p>There are two types of Video Cloud playlists:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Manual</strong> - With a manual playlist, you assign specific videos to the playlist and re-order them manually.</li>
      <li><strong>Smart</strong> - With a smart playlist, the list of videos in the playlist is constructed automatically, based on video tags or other video properties. Smart playlists are dynamic and automatically update based upon the videos in your media library and the rules that define the playlist.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A maximum of 100 videos can be added to a playlist (both Manual and Smart). There is no limit to the number of playlists that can be created. The videos that are initially loaded into a playlist in the player is determined by the type of playlist:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Manual Playlists</strong> - Videos are loaded into the playlist based upon the order of the videos in the manual playlist</li>
      <li><strong>Smart Playlists</strong> - Videos are loaded into the playlist based upon the <strong>Play Order</strong> playlist setting</li>
    </ul>
  </section>
  <section class="bcls-section">
    <h2 id="view">Viewing all Video Cloud playlists</h2>
    <p>To view all the Video Cloud playlists in the account, in the panel navigation, click <strong>All Video Cloud playlists</strong>. The page will display:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Playlist name</strong> - Name of the playlist</li>
      <li><strong>Beacon ingest</strong> - A green check indicates that the playlist has been synced to Beacon and can be placed on a page using the Layouts module</li>
      <li><strong>Reference ID</strong> - Reference ID for the playlist</li>
      <li><strong>Parameters</strong> - Parameters used to create the playlist (smart playlists only)</li>
      <li><strong>Updated date</strong> - Date the playlist was last updated</li>
      <li><strong>Video Count</strong> - Number of videos in the playlist</li>

          <p>In the tags text field, enter one or more tags (separated by commas) that will be used to define the playlist.</p>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Play Order</strong> - Controls the order in which videos in the playlist are played. The following options are available.

      <p>Smart playlists are created dynamically when the player is loaded from the available video information and so the order should always reflect current state. However, the player always gets its info via the Playback API, which uses data cached for up to 20 min. Playlists may take that long to refresh and may be behind what the CMS API would show.</p>
