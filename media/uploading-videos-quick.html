    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">Note: There is no file size limit. Brightcove has tested with uploads as large as 100GB without any issues.</aside>
    <p>Once the files have been selected, the file upload will begin. To cancel the upload, click <strong>Cancel Upload</strong>. Click <strong>Dismiss</strong> to remove the file entry from the page. <strong>While uploads are in an uploading state, do not close or move away from the browser window.</strong> Doing so may cause an incomplete upload.</p>

    <p>When the upload is complete, an <strong>Uploaded</strong> status will display. This indicates the video upload  has completed and it is safe to navigate away from the <strong>Media</strong> module.</p>
