title: "Using a Subscription Package"
description: In this topic, you will learn how to use a video subscription package that was created using the <strong>Commerce</strong> tab of Brightcove Beacon. The subscription package implements SVOD (subscription video on demand) monetization. For details on creating the subscription see the <a href="/monetization/creating-subscription-package.html">Creating a Subscription Package</a> document.

      A subscription package defines how a particular set of videos can be purchased by your apps' customers. The subscription package must be created in Brightcove Beacon, and is detailed in the <a href="/monetization/creating-subscription-package.html">Creating a Subscription Package</a> document. Also crucial in the use of the subscription package are the Video Cloud custom fields created for videos in a Video Cloud account, as detailed in the <a href="/monetization/vc-custom-fields.html">Custom Fields for Monetization</a> document. Specifically, the <a href="/monetization/vc-custom-fields.html#Rights_Management_fields">Rights Management fields</a> are used.

    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information">For more information on creating and using custom fields with Brightcove Beacon, see the <a href="/monetization/vc-custom-fields.html">Custom Fields for Monetization</a> document.</aside>
    <p>The rights management custom fields consist of:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>beacon.rights.&lt;counter&gt;.type</li>
      <li>beacon.rights.&lt;counter&gt;.startDate</li>
      <li>beacon.rights.&lt;counter&gt;.endDate</li>
      <li>beacon.rights.&lt;counter&gt;.devices</li>
      <li>beacon.rights.&lt;counter&gt;.locationsPermit</li>
      <li>beacon.rights.&lt;counter&gt;.locationsDeny</li>
      <li>beacon.rights.&lt;counter&gt;.packageName</li>
      <li>beacon.rights.&lt;counter&gt;.adConfiguration</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      First consider the <strong>&lt;counter&gt;</strong> part of each name.
      This is included as you may wish to create multiple sets of rights management fields, and the <strong>&lt;counter&gt;</strong> is utilized so you can use array type syntax to group associated fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance, say you wanted to create subscription packages around the holidays and have packages for: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Earth Day</li>
      <li>Arbor Day</li>
      <li>New Years</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      You must go into Video Cloud and create three sets of rights management fields, using counter values of 0-2 (or 1-3 if you prefer) that would appear as shown here: </p>
    <figure class="bcls-figure">
      <img class="bcls-image" src="/assets/images/monetization/using-subscription-package/index-of-rights-fields.png" alt="index of rights fields" />
    </figure>
    <p>
      To summarize, for each package you wish to use you will need to create a "counter" set of rights management fields.

    <p>
      Some custom fields to which you can assign data, and have applied to a video when ingested, can seem the same as form fields when creating your package in Brightcove Beacon. For example, the custom field <em>beacon.rights.&lt;counter&gt;.locationsDeny</em> and the package's <strong>Denied locations</strong> form field may seem like they could be in conflict. Remember, when considering these "conflicts" there are two different questions being asked, those being: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Do the rights on the video allow it to play?</li>
      <li>Is a user allowed to subscribe to the package?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Consider these scenarios:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        An end date in the <em>beacon.rights.&lt;counter&gt;.endDate</em> custom field is later than the end date of the package itself. This means the video's rights would allow it to be viewed until the custom field end date, but the user could not subscribe to the package that may have, for example, lowered the cost of viewing the video.
      </li>
      <li>
        A package is created that has permitted locations of US, Canada and Mexico, and that package is assigned to the video in the custom field <em>beacon.rights.&lt;counter&gt;.packageName</em>. Also in the video's custom fields, UK is placed in the <em>beacon.rights.&lt;counter&gt;.locationsPermit</em> custom field. The package is assigned to the video, but the package cannot be purchased in the UK. The video would be able to play in the UK, but it would could not be part of the package for a UK customer.
      </li>
      <li>
        A package is created that has permitted locations of US, Canada and Mexico. In the custom fields US and Canada are added in the video's <em>beacon.rights.&lt;counter&gt;.locationsDeny</em> custom field. Here the customers in US, Canada and Mexico could subscribe to the package, but the specific video where US and Canada are denied locations means the video could not be viewed by customers in those locations even though the video is in the package.
      </li>
    </ul>
