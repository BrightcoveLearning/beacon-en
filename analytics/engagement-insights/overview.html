    <h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>Engagement Insights is a stand-alone product focused on the frequency and intensity of viewer activity. This product helps you understand how subscribers use your Beacon app and provides a baseline success rate for encouraging customers to keep coming back. Engagement Insights reveals the audience's interaction with your app, including detailed video consumption trends, average days streamed, and activity over time.</p>
    <p>Engagement Insights includes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Viewer insights</strong></p>
        <p>Engagment Status and Viewing metrics help you to understand viewer use and patterns. The data reveals how often viewers engage, how much they engage, and the devices they engage on. This information helps you to understand how your viewer base is trending.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Content insights</strong></p>
        <p>Using the attention index and entertainment score, you can decide which content should be promoted more. The Content Catalog provides an in-depth view of all content and its performance. The Content Explorer looks for connections between content, providing clues on how to tie together promotions.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>User data sync</strong></p>
        <p>With an integration, Brightcove can sync user records that are mapped through Beacon into popular MAP/CRM systems.	This allows you to send campaigns around customer promotions.</p>

    <p>Brightcove recommends the following best practices for Engagement Insights:</p>
    <h3>Content metadata</h3>
      <p>Make sure your content is marked with the correct metadata, otherwise analytics data will not be reflected for:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Series Title</li>
        <li>Series ID</li>
        <li>Type</li>
        <li>Genre</li>
        <li>Season Number</li>
        <li>Season Episode Number</li>
        <li>Live Channel</li>
      </ul>
      <p>These fields are used to group your content within the Engagement Insights charts.</p>
      <figure class="bcls-figure">
        <img class="bcls-image--no-border" alt="Content categories" src="/assets/images/s-analytics-img/engagement-insights/content-categories.webp" />
      </figure>
      <p>Live titles are derived from the Live channel name. Otherwise, the field values come from the Media module in Studio.</p>
