    <h2 id="Favorites">Favorites</h2>
    <p>When configuring the <em>Favorites</em> core page the first decision to make is if you want all videos marked as a favorite organized by asset type. If yes, the asset types will be listed across the top of the favorites as clickable links to show only a specific asset type. If no, all the favorites will be grouped together. The following screenshots show first the organized by asset type layout and then the not grouped layout.</p>

    <p>Other configuration options are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>If you choose to organize by asset type, you can then set for each type if the thumbnails shown should be shown as landscape or portrait <strong>and</strong> if the video title should be displayed.</li>
      <li>If you do not group, you still have those display configuration options, but all thumbnails will follow the selected configuration.</li>
      <li>If you choose the portrait thumbnails you can also choose if the title position, if displayed, should be inside or outside the thumbnail.</li>
      <li>As with all core pages, you can also configure the <em>Favorites</em> page's availability.</li>

    <p>When configuring the <em>Recently Watched</em> core page the first decision to make is if you want all videos that match recently watched criteria by asset type. If yes, the asset types will be listed across the top of the recently watched as clickable links to show only a specific asset type. If no, all recently watched videos will be grouped together.
