    <p>Core pages provide you with options you wish to provide your viewers. Core pages provide:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Functionality for viewers to configure, and view information about, their app instance.</li>
      <li>Basic services like sign in, exit, logout and search.</li>
      <li>Lists of past viewer activities like recently watched, purchases, downloads and videos marked as a favorite.</li>
      <li>Display live tv and EPG (electronic program guide) schedules.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A subset of all the core pages are added to every experience, and others added through onboarding and as needs arise.</p>
    <aside class="bcls-aside bcls-aside--information language-editable">For <strong>all</strong> core pages you can edit the actual name of the page (in all supported languages) and the pages availability. This information is provided in the following table. For core pages that you can configure <em>beyond</em> to two features, there is a link in the table which will take you to configuration details.</aside>

    <h2 id="Favorites">Favorites</h2>
    <p>When configuring the <em>Favorites</em> core page the first decision to make is if you want all videos marked as a favorite organized by asset type. If yes, the asset types will be listed across the top of the favorites as clickable links to show only a specific asset type. If no, all the favorites will be grouped together. The following screenshots show first the organized by asset type layout and then the not grouped layout.</p>

      <li>If you choose the portrait thumbnails you can also choose if the title position, if displayed, should be inside or outside the thumbnail.</li>
