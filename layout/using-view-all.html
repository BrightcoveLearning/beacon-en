description: "In this topic, you will learn how to create, delete and edit default and custom view all pages. A view all page is used when the number of videos in a carousel meets a maximum threshold. When the threshold is exceeded, a <strong>View All</strong> link is displayed and when the link is clicked by the customer a new page appears displaying all videos, for instance in a grid."
